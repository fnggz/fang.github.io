# fanggz — Personal Introduction Page

This project is a personal digital introduction card developed using core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It functions as a compact, interactive, and visually polished landing page designed to represent personality, interests, and a touch of creativity through a modern UI and thoughtful user experience.

The website serves as a virtual calling card — combining visual appeal with personal storytelling in a format that’s both accessible and responsive across devices. The design utilizes modern web design trends such as glassmorphism, subtle animation, and interactive feedback.

## Project Overview

This project features a minimalist yet expressive single-page layout that includes the following components:

- **Profile Section**: Displays a circular profile image, a stylized name title, and age.
- **Information Sections**:
  - *Hobbies*: A short description of interests and daily pastimes.
  - *Likes*: A list of things that bring joy or comfort.
  - *Dislikes*: Things that may cause discomfort or irritation, shared with authenticity.
- **External Link**: A button leading to an external social/contact page for further connection.
- **Interactive Elements**:
  - Simulated window control buttons (Minimize, Close, Info) with contextual JavaScript responses.
  - Contextual notifications styled using blur and shadow effects.
  - A hidden content (not sensitive) feature accessible via password prompt, used to reveal bonus content and demonstrate playful interactivity.

All elements are styled with responsive and mobile-first principles in mind, ensuring usability across smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

## Technologies Used

The website is built using only frontend technologies, with no frameworks or external libraries. The stack includes:

- **HTML5**: Markup structure using semantic elements for clean and readable code.
- **CSS3**: Custom styles for layout, responsiveness, animations, transitions, and media queries.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Logic for user interactivity, element manipulation, event handling, and custom modal behavior.

There are no external dependencies, which improves performance and ensures full control over the codebase.

3. Commit your changes to the `main` (or `master`) branch.
4. Go to your repository’s **Settings > Pages**.
5. Under “Source,” select the `main` branch and the `/ (root)` folder.
6. Click “Save.” GitHub will build and host the site.
7. After a few moments, your personal webpage will be live at:  
   `https://your-github-username.github.io/`

Replace `your-github-username` with your actual GitHub username.

## Customization Notes

- The content and tone are intentionally expressive, humorous, and personal. Users who wish to repurpose the site for more formal or professional contexts can easily adjust the text content, image sources, or button functionality.
- The “hidden” section behind a password prompt is included as an hidden content. It does not store, send, or track any sensitive data and serves solely as a creative demonstration of UI interaction using prompt validation.
- The note system can be extended to act as modal dialogues or notifications for future features.
