This project is a personal digital card created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a stylish and interactive landing page that reflects a bit of who I am, with some creative UI elements, animation, and light-hearted interactivity.

- Profile image and introductory text
- Sections for hobbies, likes, and dislikes

- Hidden content accessible via password prompt
